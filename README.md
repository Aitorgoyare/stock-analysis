###### The purpose and background
The purpose of the project is to help Steve evaluate stocks of green energy companies to assess the diversification potential of investment funds. Using Vba Script we can analyze with just one click a lot of information quickly.

In this original script we were able to run all the 2017 and 2018 data in the following amount of time.



After refactoring the code we were able to get the VBA script to run faster.

###### Results

Advantages of code refactoring.

* Refactoring code makes it easier to read and understand.

* Fewer steps make the code faster to run.



Disadvantages of code refactoring.

* Depending on the size of the script it can make refactoring take a long period of time, where a time/cost analysis would have to be performed.

*It may be that after a refactoring of the script is accomplished it may make it slightly faster or perhaps slower.
